# The master TODO list.

## lollogs

* Separate out the Action script stuff from the game logs stuff.  Game logs should really be moved to the yesod app because they aren't needed for any other component.

## lollogs-client

* The client could use a GUI (wxWidgets or GTK maybe) at least to give the user a sense of what's going on.
* Better error handling and reporting.

## LoLLogsWebApp

* Game-index
    * Whole-row is clickable.
    * Add creation date.
* Game-view
    * Make the details under each summoner expandable.
* Summoner-info
    * Game list on summoner info page.
    * Ability to create charts on the summoner-view page.
    * Summary row to the stats table.
* Champions
    * Champs should not be editable publicly.
    * Champs should have a view page that lets you view some stats about them (could be complicated)
