# The master TODO list.

## lollogs

* Separate out the ActionScript stuff from the game logs stuff.  Game logs should really be moved to the yesod app because they aren't needed for any other component.

## lollogs-client

* The client could use a GUI (wxWidgets or GTK maybe) at least to give the user a sense of what's going on.
    - [Done] Abandoned GTK and WX.
    - [Done] Starting on C#.NET solution.
    * Setup sys-tray file watching.  Just poll every 15 minutes.  No need to worry about watching for changes.
        * "Upload Now" button.
    * Startup item!
* Clean up the details window.  Maybe log to a file instead.

## Upgrade to 0.9.4

- [Done] Add logging statements with $(logDebug)!

## LoLLogsWebApp

* Auth
    * Figure out an auth solution.  Make sure we can flag users as admins.
    * Could use some CRUD scaffolding around users.
* Game-index
    - [Done] Whole-row is clickable.
    - [Done] Add creation date.
    * Sort by date.
* Game-view
    - [Done] Make the details under each summoner expandable.
    - Format summoner details.
* Summoner-info
    - [Done] Game list on summoner info page.
    * Ability to create custom charts/tables on the summoner-view page.
    - [Done] Summary row to the stats table.
* Champions
    - [Done] Champs should not be editable publicly.
    * Champs should have a view page that lets you view some stats about them (could be complicated)
* General
    - [Done] Google Analytics.
